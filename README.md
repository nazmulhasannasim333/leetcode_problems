# 📘 LeetCode Problem Tracker by Topic

Welcome! This repository is a structured collection of LeetCode problems I’ve solved — organized by **data structure** or **topic** (like Linked List, Array, Tree, etc.).

Each topic has its own markdown file, and every problem entry includes:
- Problem Title  
- Difficulty Level  
- Direct Link

---


> Each `.md` file contains a topic-wise list of problems with relevant metadata.

1. Open any file (e.g., `linked_list.md`) to see problems related to that topic.
2. Click on the link to view the LeetCode problem.
